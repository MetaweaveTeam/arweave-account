/**
 * Explaination of NO_AVATAR_FLAG and NO_BANNER_FLAG values:
 * 
 * The arweave-account protocol used these txids as default values when the user didn't set a custom avatar or banner.
 * It turns out that when the users updated their profile, those data got written as part of their profile data ðŸ˜….
 * 
 * With the update of being able to set different default avatars and banners, I turned those values into flags
 * indicating if the user has an avatar or banner set so the library update compatible with the protocol without
 * breaking change.
